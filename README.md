# Project #3: SQL [General]
[![Python application test with Github Actions](https://github.com/nogibjj/Xiaoquan_Liu_Project3/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nogibjj/Xiaoquan_Liu_Project3/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Welcome! This is my third project for the Data Engineering System class at Duke. 

### 1. Created a Database, Connected to it, Created a Table, and Inseted Data into that Table

For this project, I generated a script that connected to a database called `Walmart_Coffee_Listings.db` , which I created myself using sqlite3 packages in python. In the database, I created a table called `Walmart_Coffee` and inserted the Walmart coffee listings data that I found in Kaggle into that table.

I then defined some questions about coffee at Walmart and used `SQL` queries to find answers to those questions.


### 2. Coffee CLI Written in Python Script Using Click

Based on my analysis, I built a command-line application with `Click` to better provide information about Walmart coffee.

`Commands` include: 

**· Number_of_type**  --- Which coffee type has the highest rating?

**· Most_popular**    --- Which coffee type is the most popular?

**· Most_expensive**  --- Which coffee type is the most expensive?

**· Highest_rating**  --- Which coffee type has the highest rating?

**· Weight**          --- What coffee type has the highest/lowest weight?
